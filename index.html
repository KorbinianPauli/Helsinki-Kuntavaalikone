                            <h4>Who created this website?</h4>
                            <p>The website was created by me, Korbinian Pauli. I have a B.A. in Political and Computer Science from the University of Munich and a M.Sc. in Social Data Science from the University of Copenhagen. I made this website partially as a project to showcase my skills to potential employers and partially so that people in Helsinki have an alternative to Yle's Vaalikone. Traditional election compass tools are forward looking and are lacking detailed information on what has been decided in the past. This website aims to simplify getting information about current decision making, particularly for international residents who may have difficulties finding information in English.</p>

                            <h4>Where does the data come from and is the information displayed here accurate?</h4>
                            <p>The data is primarily based on the meeting minutes of the Helsinki City Council, but also supplemented with the official voting results of 2021 from Statistics Finland. The summaries, classifications, and topic analyses presented on this website are generated using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and should be considered supplementary information. While considerable effort has been invested in validating the accuracy of the English language results, users are advised to exercise critical judgment and consult trusted, official sources such as the Helsinki City Council website (https://paatokset.hel.fi/fi) for definitive information.</p>
